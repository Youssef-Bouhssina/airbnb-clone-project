### Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Identifying the design properties of a mockup, such as colors and typography, ensures visual consistency and adherence to branding guidelines throughout the project. It allows developers and designers to maintain a unified look and feel, reduce implementation errors, and create a seamless user experience that aligns closely with the original design vision.

### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A user-friendly booking system is crucial for ensuring a seamless experience. It reduces friction during navigation, enhances trust and engagement, and increases conversion rates. Clear layout, intuitive interactions, and responsive design are essential to delivering a positive user experience that encourages users to complete their bookings.
